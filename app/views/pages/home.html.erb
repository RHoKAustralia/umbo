    <h1 class="jumbotron-heading text-light">Speech Therapy</h1>
    <p class="lead-text text-light">Allied health services such as speech and occupational therapy enable people to participate in society better -
  through access to education, employment and social interactions. In rural and remote Australia, children in need are often unable to these services.</p>
    <p class="jumbotron-heading text-light">Enter Umbo.</p>
    <p class="lead-text text-light"> Umbo matches a clinician in city to a family in the bush to deliver therapy through an online platform.</p>
    <p class="lead-text text-light">We support children to access vital therapy regardless of where they live, whilst also giving therapists the option of working from home -
  whenever they like, for as many or as few hours as they like. Families who have NDIS funding are able to use this funding to connect with an Umbo therapist.</p>
    <p class="lead-text text-light">We do it through an integrated solution which combines video calling, record keeping and goal setting,
  the ability to transfer files and share therapy resources, and track progress through gamification</p>
